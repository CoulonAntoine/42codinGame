# 42CodingGame

## Description

This is my submission at the hackaton [#42codinGameContest](https://www.codingame.com/hackathon/42-coding-challenge) organised by the [42Network](https://www.42.fr/42-network/) and [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/).
Students from the 42 network all around the world fought in a minigame inspired by [Quidditch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch) where our characters where controlled by the code we wrote.
I decided to write my bot in Typescript because I use Javascript frequently but the Object-oriented capabilites of Typescript made my code easier to understand and modify.
